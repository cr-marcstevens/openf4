This package provides an implementation of the F4 algorithm over finite fields.
The prime fields of characteristic < 2^32 and the binary field extensions of degree < 64 are handled natively.
For prime fields of characteristic > 2^32 you need Givaro.
Other finite fields are not handled.

A basic installation could be done with:
./configure
make 
make install

\page bug_transform Bug "Input polynomials must not have two different terms with the same monomial"

Verify your input polynomials. 

To be sure that none of them has several terms with the same monomial you can use Sage.

For instance

<UL>
    <LI> R.<x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5> = GF(65521)[]
    <LI> x0*x1 + 2*x1*x2 + 3*x0*x1
</UL>

results in 4*x0*x1 + 2*x1*x2.

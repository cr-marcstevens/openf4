Gr√∂ebner basis computation needs a lot of memory: on a computer with 4 Go of RAM the computation of Katsura 12 use all the memory.

If you are using the "template library method", select carefully your Element type.

The more the base type (int16_t, int32_t, int64_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t) is small, the less you need memory. 

You can use top or htop programs to observe your memory consumption.
